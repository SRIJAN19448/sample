    Rockstar Games, Inc. (sometimes referred to as Rockstar NYC) is an American video game publisher, best known for their 
    <font color="blue">Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead, Midnight Club, Max Payne, The Warriors, Bully, and Manhunt games.</font>
    Based in New York City, it was set up by Take-Two Interactive in December 1998, as successor to British video game publisher BMG Interactive Entertainment, a division of BMG Entertainment, from Bertelsmann, which was previously acquired. While some of the studios Take-Two Interactive has acquired have been merged into the Rockstar brand, several other recent ones have retained their previous identities and have become part of Take-Two Interactive's 2K Games subsidiary.</font>
