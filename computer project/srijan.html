    Capcom Co., Ltd., or Capcom, is a Japanese developer and publisher of video games, known for creating multi-million-selling franchises such as<font color="blue"> Mega Man, Street Fighter, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Ace Attorney, and Monster Hunter</font>, as well as games based on the Disney animated properties. Originally established in 1979, it has since become an international enterprise with subsidiaries in North America, Europe, and East Asia. It also published and developed several titles for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii, based on original intellectual property: Lost Planet, Dead Rising, Dragon's Dogma, Asura's Wrath and Zack and Wiki. During this period, Capcom also helped publish several original titles from then up and coming Western developers in titles like<font color="blue"> Remember Me, Dark Void and Spyborgs</font>, titles that many other publishers were not willing to take a chance on.</font>
