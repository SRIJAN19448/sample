    Counter-Strike (officially abbreviated as CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games, in which teams of terrorists and counter-terrorists battle to, respectively, perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking) and prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first version of Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification for Half-Life and designed by<font color="blue"> Minh "Gooseman" Le and Jess "Cliffe" Cliffe</font>, before the rights to the game's intellectual property were acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of Half-Life.
    The game was followed-up with Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. Later that same year, Counter-Strike: Source was released by Valve. Released only eight months after Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, in November 2004, the game was a remake of the original Counter-Strike and the first in the series to run on Valve's newly created Source engine. This series presently includes<font color="blue"> Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source,
    Counter-Strike Neo, Counter-Strike Online, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Counter-Strike Online 2, Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies</font>
