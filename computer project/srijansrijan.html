    Sony Interactive Entertainment (abbreviated as SIE and formerly known as Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCEI) and Sony Network Entertainment) is a multinational video game developer, product manufacturer and research and development company, and is an owned subsidiary and part of the Consumer Products and Services Group of Sony.
    The company was founded and established on November 16, 1993, as 
    Sony Computer Entertainment, to handle Sony's venture into video game development. Since the successful launch of the original PlayStation console in 1994, the company has since been developing the PlayStation lineup of home video game consoles and accessories. Expanding upon North America and other countries, the company soon became Sony's main resource for research and development in video games and interactive entertainment. It is famous for<font color="blue"> The Last Of Us, God Of War, Beyond:Two Souls, Killzone, MediEvil and Bloodborne</font>. In April 2016, SCE and Sony Network Entertainment was restructured and reorganized into Sony Interactive Entertainment, carrying over the operations and primary objectives from both companies.
    Sony Interactive Entertainment handles the research and development, production, and sales of both hardware and software for the PlayStation video game systems. Alongside, it is also a developer and publisher of video game titles and is composed of several subsidiaries of Sony's largest markets: North America, Europe and Asia.
